# Serverless Portfolio Engineering

 > **Status:** Production (CI/CD Live)
 > **Tech Stack:** AWS S3, CloudFront, OIDC, GitHub Actions

 This document explains the architectural decisions behind this portfolio website.

## 🎯 The Challenge

 I needed a professional portfolio that was fast, secure, and cost-effective, without the overhead of managing servers (EC2).

## 🏗️ The Solution

 I implemented a **Serverless Architecture** using AWS managed services.

### Key Components

 1. **Storage (S3):** Hosts the static HTML/CSS assets generated by MkDocs. The bucket is completely private.
 2. **Delivery (CloudFront):** Acts as a global CDN, caching content at the edge for low latency. It connects to S3 securely using **Origin Access Control (OAC)**.
 3. **Security (OIDC):** Instead of storing long-lived AWS keys in GitHub Secrets (security risk), I configured **OpenID Connect**. GitHub Actions assumes a temporary IAM Role only during deployment.

## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline

 Every commit to the `main` branch triggers the following automated workflow:

 1. **Build:** Python environment is set up, and MkDocs compiles the Markdown to HTML.
 2. **Auth:** GitHub requests a temporary token from AWS STS.
 3. **Deploy:** The `aws s3 sync` command updates only the changed files.
 4. **Refresh:** The CloudFront cache is invalidated to show changes immediately.

## 💰 FinOps (Cost Analysis)

* **Hosting:** ~$0.01 (S3 Storage)
* **Compute:** $0.00 (Static Site)
* **CDN:** Free Tier (1TB/month)
* **Total Estimated:** < $0.10 / month
