# Giovanni Polette's Portfolio

 **Bringing ideas to life through technology experimentation. Focused on simple, yet powerful implementations that drive real-world professional utility.**

     **This portfolio is a Serverless Engineering Project.**

     Unlike traditional static sites, this environment is deployed via a fully automated CI/CD pipeline on AWS using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
